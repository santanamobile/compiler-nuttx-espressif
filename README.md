# Nuttx Firmware Builder for Espressif Modules

This work is based on [this](https://developer.espressif.com/blog/nuttx-getting-started/) blog post.

The main goal is deploy development tools to use nuttx to build firmware for espressif's SOCs.

## Container Specs

- Linux Distro (on Dockerfile): Ubuntu 22.04
- Toolchains: RISC-V and Xtensa

## Target Hardware

The Espressifâ€™s SoCs supported on NuttX are divided in these two architectures:

- RISC-V: ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2
- Xtensa: ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3

## Requirements

Before start, you must have the Docker runtime installed on your machine. You can obtain the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Toolchains

This container have the toolchains to RISC-V SoCs and Xtensa.

## Credentials

The default username of the container is 'espressif', the UID and GID are the same of the container creator.

The root password is: rootpass
The espressif password is: espressif
BTW, the espressif user is in the sudoers file

## Build Container

This is the command to build the Docker image from scratch:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --build-arg "HOST_UID=$(id -u)" --build-arg "HOST_GID=$(id -g)" --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t compiler-nuttx-espressif:v1.0 .
```

The whole process takes approximately 6 minutes to complete.

Check the result image size:

```bash
$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY                 TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
compiler-nuttx-espressif   v1.0      2080a0f050c0   xx seconds ago   4.79GB
```

## How to use

Choose an empty folder on your machine and run the container.

If you want build (and flash) the firmware image on the board, you must connect the board on the machine before start the container.

```bash
mkdir ~/some-empty-folder
cd ~/some-empty-folder
```

Download the Nuttx files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/nuttx.git nuttx
git clone https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps apps
```

This step may be done inside the container as well, in this case you must change to /project folder.

Run the container.

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v "${PWD}/project" compiler-nuttx-espressif:v1.0
```

NuttX provides ready-to-use board default configurations that enable the required config (from Kconfig) for a use scenario, in this case i'll use the example of nsh for the board franzininho-wifi.

First of all, we have to ensure that no previous config exists.

```bash
make distclean
```

Configure nuttx to generate a .config file for franzininho-wifi.

```bash
./tools/configure.sh franzininho-wifi:nsh
```

Before building and flashing the firmware, it is necessary build the bootloader.

```bash
make bootloader
```

Build and flash firmware image with this command:

```bash
make flash ESPTOOL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 ESPTOOL_BINDIR=./
```

When flashing is complete you can monitor the device serial port. In this case we will use picocom to open a serial console by running:

```bash
picocom -b115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

To quit picocom, first press CRTL + A followed by a regular x.
